# MandiSystem
Through this project, we aim to show that a transparent and honest 
system can exist where the farmer’s and the consumer’s best interests 
are protected at all times. The existing issues of crop damage, wastage 
and hoarding can also be prevented if we have accurate data and 
information about the whole process. In the end, we want our project 
to tackle a real-life issue with the hope that our thought process and 
idea can help the agricultural sector of India
